# 🚀 CodeAlpha Internship Tasks 
📅 *Internship Duration: January 15, 2025 – February 15, 2025*  

Welcome to my *CodeAlpha Internship* project repository! This repository showcases my journey through various Python-based projects, focusing on game development, chatbot creation, and task automation.  

## *📌 Internship Tasks*  

### 🏆 Task 1: 🎮 Hangman Game – Guess the Word!  
A *classic word-guessing game* where the player attempts to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of incorrect attempts before the game ends.  

🔹 *Skills Used:* Loops, Conditionals, String Manipulation  
🔹 *Concepts Learned:* Game Logic, User Input Handling  

### 🏆 Task 2: 🤖 Basic Chatbot – AI-Powered Conversations  
A *simple chatbot* that interacts with users by responding to predefined inputs. While it doesn’t use advanced AI, it mimics a structured conversation, providing a fun and interactive experience.  

🔹 *Skills Used:* Dictionaries, Functions, Input Processing  
🔹 *Concepts Learned:* Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics, Response Handling  

### 🏆 Task 3: ⚙ Task Automation – Organizing Files Automatically  
A *Python script for automation* that organizes files based on their types. It scans a directory, categorizes files (e.g., images, documents, videos), and moves them into relevant folders automatically.  

🔹 *Skills Used:* File Handling, OS Operations, Scripting  
🔹 *Concepts Learned:* Automation, Productivity Enhancement  

## *🔚 Conclusion*  

Completing these tasks as part of the *CodeAlpha Internship* has been an enriching experience. Each project enhanced my *problem-solving skills, deepened my **understanding of Python, and gave me hands-on experience with **real-world applications*.  

From *game development* to *chatbot interactions* and *workflow automation*, these projects have strengthened my coding expertise. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and working on more innovative projects in the future! 🚀
